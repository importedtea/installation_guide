# Nautilus has no option to right click and create a new text file.
# You can get around this with the following:
  # Navigate to your home directory using
  # List all files
  # Look for Templates
  # Touch a new file
  # Return to Nautilus and right click to find New Document option
  
# List of commands in order
cd
cd Templates
touch file.txt

# Note:
# It seems you can only create a text file no matter what extension you give it.
# Maybe there are other ways of adding other extension files.
# This is just a preferred method of making a quick text file to add some notes.
