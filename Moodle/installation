#Moodle will be installed on RHEL Server 7.4

Section 0: System Specs
===================================
          SYSTEM SPECS
===================================
#The installation is starting on a freshly setup VM on VirtualBox
#The system is setup with 1024 MB RAM

#Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.4 (Maipo)
#Kernel 3.10.0-693.e17.x86_64 on an x86_64

Section 1: Network Configuration
===================================
          NETWORK CONFIG
===================================
#The first thing we want to do on a fresh install of RHEL on a VM is check network connectivity.
#First ping Google's DNS
ping 8.8.8.8

#If the network is unreachable, do the following
nmtui

#This opens a text-based GUI manager to activate the connection.
#Select Activate a connection.
#Choose your interface with enter.
#Navigate to back.
#Quit

Section 1.2 Setting Your Hostname
===================================
       HOSTNAME CONFIGURATION
===================================
#In the case of using Moodle in your organization, you will need to supply your computer with a hostname that is not localhost.
#Note: The hostname can be different than your fully qualitfied domain name, however, it should probably just be the same to make life easier.

#First let's use a simple command to check what our hostname is:
hostnamectl status

#Setting your hostname
hostnamectl set-hostname geeklab    ## static
hostnamectl set-hostname "Geeks LAB"   ## pretty




Section 2: Update Your System
===================================
          UPDATE SYSTEM
===================================
#It is always a good idea to update your system on a fresh install.
#When using YUM to install/update your system it will try to look for repositories to pull packages.
#A repository is essentially, as the name suggests, a location to store files.
#These repositories can have files with extension .rpm, .txt, etc.
#A .rpm package will contain commands to build and compile code, once completed, it is pushed to a repo.
#You install a repo to your system and then use yum to add it to /etc/yum.repos.d
#When you run yum update, it goes to that file and pulls any new repos; this is how companies push updates to packages.

#Run the following command to check for updates on the system
#Note, this will not actually update the system, it will just show you what is there in case you don't want to install something you don't want.
yum check-update

#Once you have verified that all the updates are "to your standards", run the following command
yum update

Section 2.1 Registering Your System
===================================
       SYSTEM REGISTRATION
===================================
#When using RHEL, you can only use the package managers with a valid subscription.
#This can be done with the following command
subscription-manager register

#This will prompt you to enter a username and password.
#The username and password are what you use to log into the RHEL Customer Portal.


Section 3: Installing Packages
===================================
       PACKAGE INSTALLATION
===================================
#We will need a few packages in order to get Moodle up and running.
#Moodle is, essentially, a web server that generates default template web pages, and a web interface that allows users to edit.
# Think of it as a website builder, like Weebly/Wix, just 100% different in terms of functionality.

#Let's start with the packages we will need.
3.1: Apache/httpd.service
|------ #First, let's check to see if httpd.service is on your system
|------ systemctl status httpd (can also run command service httpd status)
|------
|------ #On RHEL 7.4 it is not installed by default.
|------ #Let's install it with yum
|------ yum install httpd
|
|------ #You will notice it installs a few dependencies, these are necessary for the service to run, press y to continue.
|
|------ #Finally, let's check the status of httpd one more time.
|------ systemctl status httpd (you should now see green text stating 
3.2: mysql-server
|------ 
3.3: php
3.4: php-mysql

#Note: To get a feel for the previous four packages, I recommend looking at http://www.rpmfind.net
# This will explain in detail what each package means, and its intended purposes.
